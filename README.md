# Pebble Compass

Shows a white compass rose on black background, a level indicator and two text layers showing the current heading angle in degrees and as short direction text, e.g. "N" or "NE".
It smoothly transitions to a second representation as band if you hold your watch upright.
Also, the compass value fakes a physical model with friction and inertia.

## Components

- `data_provider.{h,c}`
	- offers various callbacks to combine accelerometer, compass data, orientation changes and other meaningful events
	- not used in this app: callbacks to modify the calculated value, head to a different angle but 0ยบ, etc.
		
- `compass_window.{h,c}`
	- main window that mediates between the data provider and the various layers,
	- Mananges a transition state between "rose" and "band" to layout its various sub layers
	- presents and dismisses the calibration window according to `data_provider_compass_needs_calibration()`
	
- `compass_calibration_window.{h,c}`	
	- window to encourage the user to perform movements that will help the compass to calibrate
	- has no real knowledge over the compass calibration
	- has a super simple API and should be shared with other developers to do calibration
	
- 'ticks_layer.{h,c}`, renders the actual compass rose/band
- 'inverted_cross_hair_layer.{h,c}`, needed to draw the cross-hair with public API (this is sad, see comments in the code)
